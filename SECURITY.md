# Security Policy 🛡️

"National Security is the priority. Code Security is the second priority (right after lunch break)."

## 📢 Vulnerability Reporting

If you find a security vulnerability ("shell", webshell, SQL Injection, or backdoor access) in this project, please follow these protocols:

1.  **DO NOT** make it viral on Twitter/X. We panic easily.
2.  Send a confidential report to: `report@cyber-agency-mulyono.go.id` (This email is fictional, like campaign promises).
3.  Wait for 2x24 hours. If there is no reply, assume it is "under investigation".

## 🔍 Supported Versions

| Version | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1.0.x | ✅ **Supported** | Active term. |
| 0.x.x | ❌ **Impeached** | No longer in power. Do not dig up the past. |

## 🚫 What is NOT considered a vulnerability

The following are not bugs, but features:
1.  **Memory Leak**: This is "Resource Sharing Program".
2.  **Process Crash**: This is "Unannounced Field Visit" (Blusukan) to the OS.
3.  **Slow Performance**: This is "Digital Bureaucracy" to ensure authenticity.

## 🤝 Our Commitment

We are committed to patching vulnerabilities as fast as possible, depending on budget availability and developer mood.
